  "description": "When using a move, the next basic attack becomes a boosted attack. When hitting an enemy with a basic attack or move, a cinder is placed on that enemy. Attacking a cindered enemy a certain number of times will cause the cinder to flare, dealing damage to the enemy. When at half HP or less, critical-hit rate and basic attack speed are increased for a short time.",
